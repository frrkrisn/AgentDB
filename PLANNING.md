# AgentDB - 4 Day Implementation Plan

## Purpose

This file is the execution roadmap for building AgentDB with AI coding tools.

The project will be developed over four focused days.

IMPORTANT:
- Do not attempt all four days at once.
- Complete only the current day when instructed.
- The user will ask what to do for a particular day.
- Before implementing anything, inspect the current project state.
- `PROMPT.md` is the architectural source of truth.
- This file is the implementation roadmap.

# DAY 1 - FOUNDATION + DATABASE

## Goal

Create the complete project foundation and establish the relational database architecture.

### Step 1: Repository structure

Create:

```text
AgentDB/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── database/
├── docs/
├── PROMPT.md
├── PLANNING.md
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

Do not build application features yet.

---

## Step 2: Frontend foundation

Set up:

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- React Router
- Axios
- Recharts
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Lucide icons

Create a minimal application shell.

Verify that the frontend runs.

---

## Step 3: Backend foundation

Set up:

- Python environment
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- Pydantic
- Alembic
- JWT dependencies
- password hashing

Create:

```text
backend/app/
├── main.py
├── core/
├── models/
├── schemas/
├── routers/
├── services/
├── repositories/
└── utils/
```

Create a health endpoint:

```text
GET /health
```

Verify FastAPI runs.

---

## Step 4: MySQL

Create the AgentDB MySQL database.

Establish:

- connection configuration
- SQLAlchemy engine/session
- environment variables
- migration foundation

---

## Step 5: Design database schema

Implement the core tables:

```text
users
agents
tasks
runs
events
logs
metrics
alerts
audit_logs
```

Add:

- PKs
- FKs
- constraints
- timestamps
- statuses
- relationships

Use normalized relational design.

---

## Step 6: Indexes

Add justified indexes for:

- timestamps
- severity
- agent IDs
- run IDs
- event types
- statuses

Document why each important index exists.

---

## Step 7: Seed data

Create realistic development data.

Include enough records to make the dashboard and analytics meaningful later.

Do not use random nonsense data.

---

## Step 8: Database advanced features

Begin implementing:

- views
- stored procedures
- triggers

At minimum create the planned performance/error/health views and meaningful procedures/triggers.

---

## Step 9: Day 1 verification

Verify:

```text
Frontend runs
Backend runs
MySQL connects
Migrations work
Tables exist
Relationships work
Seed data loads
Indexes exist
Views work
Procedures work
Triggers work
```

Create a Git checkpoint.

---

# DAY 2 - BACKEND + API

## Goal

Build the complete backend and make the database accessible through a secure API.

---

## Step 1: Authentication

Implement:

```text
/register
/login
/me
```

Use:

- authentication dependency

Test authentication.

---

## Step 2: Agent APIs

Implement:

```text
GET    /agents
POST   /agents
GET    /agents/{id}
PUT    /agents/{id}
DELETE /agents/{id}
```

Add:
- validation
- pagination
- filtering

```text
Login
→ Dashboard
→ Agent
→ Task
→ Run
→ Events
→ Logs
→ Analytics
→ Alert
→ Audit
→ Database Explorer
```

Fix anything that breaks.

---

## Step 9: Final Git checkpoint

Create:

```text
release: AgentDB final academic build
```

Only after verifying the project.

# AI TOOL RESPONSIBILITIES

## Antigravity

Use Antigravity primarily for:

- understanding the complete project
- navigating the shared repository
- coordinating multi-file changes
- project-level architecture
- frontend visual development
- integration
- running the application
- inspecting the whole system
- verifying the application as a complete product

Antigravity must follow `PROMPT.md`.

---

## Codex

Use Codex primarily for:

- backend implementation
- SQL
- database logic
- API implementation
- tests
- refactoring
- bug fixing
- targeted implementation tasks
- code review

Codex must follow `PROMPT.md` and this `PLANNING.md`.

---

# COLLABORATION RULES

The two AI tools are working on the same folder.

Therefore:

1. Never blindly overwrite existing files.
2. Always inspect the current state.
3. Read `PROMPT.md` first.
4. Check `git status`.
5. Check recent changes when necessary.
6. Avoid editing the same files simultaneously.
7. Keep commits/checkpoints frequent.
8. After major changes, run the application/tests.
9. Document architectural changes.
10. Never assume another tool's changes are disposable.

---

# DAILY OPERATING RULE

When the user says:

"Start Day 1"

Only perform Day 1.

When the user says:

"Start Day 2"

First inspect what Day 1 actually completed, then continue from the current state.

Never assume previous phases are complete merely because the plan says they should be.

The actual repository state always wins.

---

# IMPORTANT FREE-TIER STRATEGY

The project is intentionally divided into four days.

Do not waste AI usage on generating huge amounts of code in a single request.

Use small, verifiable tasks.

Preferred cycle:

```text
Inspect
↓
Plan
↓
Implement
↓
Run
↓
Test
↓
Fix
↓
Checkpoint
```

This reduces wasted generations and makes it easier to recover from AI mistakes.
