AgentDB

AI-Agent Observability & Structured Logging Platform powered by a relational database

AgentDB is a full-stack observability and structured logging platform designed for monitoring AI-agent workflows, executions, events, logs, metrics, alerts, and audit activity through a unified dashboard.

The project is built with React + TypeScript, FastAPI, and MySQL, with the relational database serving as the core of the system. It is designed to demonstrate advanced Database Management System (DBMS) concepts through a practical, real-world application rather than a basic CRUD project.

🚀 Project Overview

Modern AI-agent systems can involve multiple agents, tasks, executions, database operations, failures, and performance metrics. Tracking all of this through unstructured logs quickly becomes difficult.

AgentDB addresses this problem by providing a structured platform where agent activity can be:

Registered and managed

Organized into tasks and execution runs

Captured as structured events and logs

Measured through performance metrics

Analyzed through dashboards and reports

Monitored through configurable alerts

Tracked through an audit trail

The system combines a modern developer-oriented interface with a carefully designed relational database architecture.

🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of AgentDB are:

Build a practical full-stack application around a relational database.

Demonstrate advanced DBMS concepts in a real-world scenario.

Provide structured logging for AI-agent executions.

Enable searching, filtering, and analyzing execution data.

Provide performance and failure analytics.

Implement alerts for abnormal agent behavior.

Maintain an audit trail of important system actions.

Demonstrate database integrity, transactions, indexing, views, stored procedures, and triggers.

Provide a clean and presentation-ready developer dashboard.

🔌 API Structure

The backend API is organized into logical modules:

/auth
/agents
/tasks
/runs
/logs
/events
/metrics
/analytics
/alerts
/audit

Example endpoints:

POST   /auth/register
POST   /auth/login
GET    /auth/me

GET    /agents
POST   /agents
GET    /agents/{id}
PUT    /agents/{id}
DELETE /agents/{id}

GET    /tasks
POST   /tasks
GET    /tasks/{id}

GET    /runs
POST   /runs
GET    /runs/{id}

GET    /logs
GET    /logs/{id}

GET    /events
GET    /metrics

GET    /analytics/overview
GET    /analytics/agents
GET    /analytics/errors
GET    /analytics/latency

GET    /alerts
POST   /alerts
PUT    /alerts/{id}
DELETE /alerts/{id}

GET    /audit

The API structure may evolve during implementation while preserving the overall architecture.

🔒 Security

AgentDB follows basic application security practices including:

Password hashing

JWT authentication

Protected API routes

Authorization checks

Request validation

SQL injection protection through ORM/query parameterization

Environment-based secrets

CORS configuration

No credentials committed to the repository

Sensitive configuration should be stored in environment variables.

👥 Team

AgentDB is being developed as a collaborative academic project.

Project Repository: GitHub

Team members and contribution details can be added here as the project progresses.

📚 Academic Purpose

AgentDB is developed as a DBMS course project with the goal of demonstrating how database concepts can be applied to a realistic software system.

Rather than implementing isolated SQL examples, the project integrates DBMS concepts into a complete workflow:

Agent
  ↓
Task
  ↓
Execution / Run
  ↓
Events + Logs + Metrics
  ↓
Analytics
  ↓
Alerts
  ↓
Audit Trail

This allows the database concepts to be demonstrated through an actual application and end-to-end data flow.

🔮 Future Scope

Potential future enhancements include:

Real-time log streaming

WebSocket-based monitoring

Advanced anomaly detection

AI-assisted log summarization

Distributed agent monitoring

Role-based access control

Notification integrations

Advanced query builder

Historical performance comparison

Multi-tenant support

These features are outside the initial academic scope unless explicitly added later.

📄 License

This project is developed for academic and educational purposes.

A formal open-source license can be added if the repository is made public.
